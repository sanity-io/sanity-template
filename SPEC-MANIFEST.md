# Sanity template manifest specification

Sanity template repositories must contain a file called `sanity-template.json`, and follow this specification.

We are working on improving the documentation for template authors. For now, please refer to the type definitions for template manifests:

- **v1** (deprecated): [src/manifest/v1/manifest.ts](src/manifest/v1/manifest.ts)
- **v2** (current): [src/manifest/v2/manifest.ts](src/manifest/v2/manifest.ts)
